Racist advert on a lotion
Have been buying from the app but recently saw an advert on a lotion which is totally racist. How can you use a black woman angry of her dark skin then happy after using the lotion and becoming light skin? Did we black skin tell you we don't love our skin or you are as ignorant as hell?

Terrible customer care
I have been the victim to a scammer who use my card on three different websites, I contacted all three stores as soon as I found out and two of the three companies were fantastic and got me my money back. Fordeal have had over a month now to deal with the issue and I cannot get anyone to contact me. Just the same message over and Over. They are so frustrating it is unbelievable. Although I have no history of buying from this shop, please be aware if anything goes wrong with your order you have virtually no chance to speak to anyone in customer care. It is horrendous.

It is awful
It is awful. I ordered two dresses and both are in a very bad quality and so short. In their pictures, they are maxi, but they are a little under knee. And for the stationeries that I ordered, very bad quality and one was broken.

Very bad quality
Very bad quality. And very expensive for what they offer. The pants look pretty in the picture and awful in real. The stiches are horrible and not straight. The blend of poliester and cotton is actually 100% poliester. The quality of underwear very bad, the blouse stiches as well awful. Jumpsuit quality awful. Shein and Jollyshic way much better quality and full description on products before you buy.
